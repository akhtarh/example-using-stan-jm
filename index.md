These are some worked examples using stan-jm code on public datasets. You can review the source code for all examples here [on the github repo](https://github.com/jburos/example-using-stan-jm).

These analyses all make use of `stan_jm`, which is available from a development branch of [rstanarm](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm) 
available at [sambrilleman/rstanarm](https://github.com/sambrilleman/rstanarm). Please refer to that repo for more information.
